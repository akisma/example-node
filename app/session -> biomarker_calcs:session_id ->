session -> biomarker_calcs:session_id ->
session -> session_exercise_assoc:session_id -> this is key value pair of exercise types since we don't know what they are
this was designed for one calc per excersise session

client_product_assoc -> what products the client is subscribed to (paying for)

sample_biomarker_result -> actual values stored here
biomarker -> actually just stores the name and description of biomarker (so like 'cortisol' 'stress hormone')

client health condition - 1:1 relationship, just a blob of notes

client fitness status assoc - ??
